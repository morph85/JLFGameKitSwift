I've digged into Apple's new [GameplayKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/GameplayKit_Guide/). It's nothing revolutionary, just a collection of solid utilities for things commonly needed while making games. I want to use it now, but for various reasons I can't run a beta OS or IDE on a regular basis.

So, since I want it now, and because I'm curious about how it's put together, I'm going to implement at least some of it from scratch, using the preliminary documentation and videos as my map.

This repository is a companion to a series of blog posts:
